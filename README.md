## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- A modern web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Edge)

### Installation

## How to Play
1. When you open the game, you'll see a grid of bubbles with numbers.
2. The game has a timer set to 60 seconds.
3. A target number is displayed in the "hit" element. Click on bubbles with numbers that match the target number to increase your score.
4. If you click on a bubble with the correct number, your score will increase by 5 points.
5. The timer counts down, and when it reaches 0, the game is over.
